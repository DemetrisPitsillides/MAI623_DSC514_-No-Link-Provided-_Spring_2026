"The graphic’s caption reads, 'According to a study by a relevant institution, radioactive material from Japan's nuclear wastewater could spread to most of the Pacific Ocean in 57 days, and to global seawater in 10 years' time'.","This caption presents speculative claims that are designed to alarm and mislead, based on unverified projections and interpretations rather than factual evidence connected to the real studies about Fukushima.",Speculation/Analysis,3
"The graphic was shared on TikTok, YouTube, Weibo, Twitter and various other social media.","This provides factual details about the platforms used to spread the graphic, useful for understanding the dissemination scope but not a direct action of disinformation propagation or adversarial intent.",General Context,1

"For example, one video produced by The People’s Daily titled “The truth of Fukushima” claimed that there was a Japanese plot to knowingly discharge water that will “change” the sea, while deliberately ignoring safer options.","The sentence illustrates a specific instance of disinformation propagated by a well-known Chinese state media outlet, indicating a deliberate action to manipulate information and propagate a false narrative against Japan.",Adversary Action,0
"It generated tens of thousands of comments, many of them highly critical of Japan.","This details the reaction to the disinformation campaign, providing context on the scale of engagement and public sentiment without indicating adversary actions or speculative interpretation.",General Context,1
